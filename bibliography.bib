            Passive daytime radiative cooling ({PDRC}) dissipates terrestrial heat to the extremely cold outer space without using any energy input or producing pollution. It has the potential to simultaneously alleviate the two major problems of energy crisis and global warming. In this review, we summarize general strategies implemented for achieving {PDRC} and various applications of {PDRC} technologies. We first introduce heat transfer processes involved in {PDRC}, including radiative and nonradiative heat transfer processes, to evaluate the {PDRC} performance. Subsequently, we summarize the general material designs used for controlling {PDRC} performance, such as tuning the thermal mid‐infrared emittance and solar reflectance. Finally, we discuss the diverse applications of {PDRC} technologies to overcome problems in space cooling, solar cell cooling, water harvesting, and electricity generation.

It also explores various materials for efficient {PDRC} construction, especially achieving an emittance (ε) of 1 in the long-wavelength infrared ({LWIR}) transmission window. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive table of previously reported {PDRC} coatings, including materials, thickness, solar reflectance, thermal {LWIR} emittance, temperature reduction, and cooling power. This article will significantly enhance my understanding of radiative cooling, including clarifying jargon in this subfield.

              Passive daytime radiative cooling ({PDRC}) involves spontaneously cooling a surface by reflecting sunlight and radiating heat to the cold outer space. Current {PDRC} designs are promising alternatives to electrical cooling but are either inefficient or have limited applicability.

High, substrate-independent hemispherical solar reflectances (0.96 ± 0.03) and long-wave infrared emittances (0.97 ± 0.02) allow for subambient temperature drops of {\textasciitilde}6°C and cooling powers of {\textasciitilde}96 watts per square meter (W m
