            Passive daytime radiative cooling ({PDRC}) dissipates terrestrial heat to the extremely cold outer space without using any energy input or producing pollution. It has the potential to simultaneously alleviate the two major problems of energy crisis and global warming. In this review, we summarize general strategies implemented for achieving {PDRC} and various applications of {PDRC} technologies. We first introduce heat transfer processes involved in {PDRC}, including radiative and nonradiative heat transfer processes, to evaluate the {PDRC} performance. Subsequently, we summarize the general material designs used for controlling {PDRC} performance, such as tuning the thermal mid‐infrared emittance and solar reflectance. Finally, we discuss the diverse applications of {PDRC} technologies to overcome problems in space cooling, solar cell cooling, water harvesting, and electricity generation.

Additionally, it provides a comprehensive table of previously reported {PDRC} coatings, including materials, thickness, solar reflectance, thermal {LWIR} emittance, temperature reduction, and cooling power. This article will significantly enhance my understanding of radiative cooling, including clarifying jargon in this subfield.

              Passive daytime radiative cooling ({PDRC}) involves spontaneously cooling a surface by reflecting sunlight and radiating heat to the cold outer space. Current {PDRC} designs are promising alternatives to electrical cooling but are either inefficient or have limited applicability.

	abstract = {The recent progress on radiative cooling reveals its potential for applications in highly efficient passive cooling. This approach utilizes the maximized emission of infrared thermal radiation through the atmospheric window for releasing heat and minimized absorption of incoming atmospheric radiation. These simultaneous processes can lead to a device temperature substantially below the ambient temperature. Although the application of radiative cooling for nighttime cooling was demonstrated a few decades ago, significant cooling under direct sunlight has been achieved only recently, indicating its potential as a practical passive cooler during the day. In this article, the basic principles of radiative cooling and its performance characteristics for nonradiative contributions, solar radiation, and atmospheric conditions are discussed. The recent advancements over the traditional approaches and their material and structural characteristics are outlined. The key characteristics of the thermal radiators and solar reflectors of the current state‐of‐the‐art radiative coolers are evaluated and their benchmarks are remarked for the peak cooling ability. The scopes for further improvements on radiative cooling efficiency for optimized device characteristics are also theoretically estimated.},

This is done through completing a sequence of steps, which we refer to as the modeling workflow. This streamlined modeling workflow is described in great detail as we show you how to develop and execute a multiphysics simulation from start to finish.

Follow along with this tutorial to see how to navigate the user interface, interact with the modeling environment, and guide you through the entire model building process.

The modeling workflow consists of the following steps:

Setting up the model environment
Building the geometry
Specifying material properties
Defining physics boundary conditions
Creating the mesh
Running the simulation
Postprocessing the results
You will also learn how to use the Application Builder, which allows you to transform a finite element model into an easy-to-use simulation application.

To demonstrate the use of the modeling workflow, we simulate the Joule heating of a busbar. The busbar is made of copper and contains bolts made of titanium. An electric potential is applied to the single bolt on one end. A pair of bolts on the other end of the busbar are grounded, thus establishing an electrical potential difference. The temperature in the busbar rises due to resistive heating. In this model, we will couple two physics, namely electrical currents and heat conduction.},
