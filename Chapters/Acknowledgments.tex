(Note to Prof. Hudgings: I intend to refine these acknowledgments to make them more personal and succinct by the time the thesis reaches the second reader).

In this section, I express my heartfelt gratitude to those who have supported me throughout this journey. First and foremost, a huge thanks to Professor Janice Hudgings, whose incredible guidance, patience, and unwavering optimism have been a beacon of light for me, especially during challenging times with COMSOL. Her enthusiasm and belief in my project have been invaluable.

A special acknowledgment goes to Professor James Higdon, whose generosity in providing his COMSOL license and desktop was instrumental in initiating my thesis work. His willingness to assist during technical difficulties and his provision of essential resources for mastering COMSOL have been fundamental to my progress.

My friends, who have been a constant source of support and encouragement, deserve a world of thanks...

The Hudgings lab members, for their insights and camaraderie, have contributed significantly to my journey...

My suitemates, for their understanding and encouragement, have made this process smoother...

And, of course, my parents, whose love and belief in me have been my foundation...
