I am deeply grateful to all who have supported me throughout this journey. I extend my heartfelt thanks to Professor Janice Hudgings, whose exceptional guidance, patience, and constant optimism have been a tremendous support, especially during challenging times with COMSOL. Her enthusiasm and faith in the progress of my project have been invaluable.

Special recognition goes to Professor James Higdon, whose generosity in providing his COMSOL license and desktop was crucial for starting my thesis work. His readiness to help during technical challenges and his provision of essential resources were pivotal to my success.

I also owe a great deal of gratitude to my friends, from suite-mates to peers in the Physics and Computer Science departments, who have consistently offered support and encouragement. The members of the Hudgings lab, too, deserve thanks for their insights and camaraderie.

Lastly, I thank my parents, Anthony Kariuki and Caroline Nyagah. Their nurturing of my curiosity and love for the sciences has shaped me into the inquisitive person I am today. Without their support, I would not be where I am today.
