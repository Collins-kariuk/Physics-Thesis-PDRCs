This thesis delves into the modeling and simulation of Passive Daytime Radiative Cooling (PDRC) devices using COMSOL Multiphysics \texttrademark, a cutting-edge computational tool. At its core, PDRC technology harnesses the principle of radiative cooling to emit heat directly into outer space, offering a sustainable solution to the pressing challenges of global warming and the energy crisis. By optimizing the optical properties and layering strategies of these devices, the thesis seeks to enhance their cooling efficiency and operational performance, providing a blueprint for future innovations in cooling technologies. Through rigorous computational analysis and simulation, it validates theoretical models and investigates the potential of various materials and configurations to improve PDRC performance, aiming to contribute significantly to the development of energy-efficient cooling solutions.
