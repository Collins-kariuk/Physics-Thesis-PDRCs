% Here is where you'll include the actual text for your abstract.  Because this lives inside the main document and will be included with a \input command, no tags are needed to start a new document.  Instead, just type.


Your abstract will summarize your thesis in one or two paragraphs.  This brief summary should emphasize methods and results, not introductory material.
