% A note on what is COMSOL.
COMSOL Multiphysics\textsuperscript{TM} is a comprehensive software suite for finite element analysis, solving, and simulation across a wide array of physics and engineering disciplines, particularly focusing on coupled phenomena and multiphysics interactions. It enables the creation and simulation of physics-based models and applications in an intuitive, interactive workspace.

COMSOL software supports a broad spectrum of applications, from electromagnetics and structural mechanics to acoustics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and chemical engineering. COMSOL features an extensive array of modules, including the Wave Optics module for optical applications simulations like wave propagation in fiber optics and photonics, the Semiconductor module for the analysis of semiconductor devices such as diodes and transistors, and the AC/DC module for examining electric and magnetic fields in static and low-frequency scenarios. For my thesis, which involves analyzing ray paths in optical systems, I will be utilizing the Ray Optics module.
